# Add new inflection rules using the following format. Inflections
# are locale specific, and you may define rules for as many different
# locales as you wish. All of these examples are active by default:
ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
  # without this, Rails attempts to look for "difes_url"
  inflect.plural /^(dive)$/i, '\1s'
  inflect.singular /^(dive)s/i, '\1'

  #   inflect.plural /^(ox)$/i, '\1en'
  #   inflect.singular /^(ox)en/i, '\1'
  #   inflect.irregular 'person', 'people'
  #   inflect.uncountable %w( fish sheep )
end

# These inflection rules are supported but not enabled by default:
# ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections(:en) do |inflect|
#   inflect.acronym 'RESTful'
# end
